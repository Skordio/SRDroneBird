# SR DroneBird

This is a website I am working on to host a side-business for FPV drone cinematic photography. Right now the side-business doesn't exist yet, as I'm still in the process of obtaining a commercial drone license under Part 107. So currently it just functions more as a place for me to post videos of my drone flying. 

You can access the site at https://srdronebird.com/
