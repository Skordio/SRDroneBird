# SR DroneBird

This is a website I am working on to host a drone photography side-business I am looking to start. Right now it doesn't exist yet, as I'm still in the process of obtaining a commercial drone license under Part 107. So right now it just functions more as a place for me to post videos of my drone flying. 

You can access the site at https://srdronebird.com/
